# SubtidalCorallines2018
This repository contains data used in Hind et al: Trophic control of coralline species diversity: how barren are urchin barrens?

Data are separated into three spreadsheets, outlined below.

(1) Hind et al_Site Survey Data.csv:

These data were generated from subtidal SCUBA surveys collected in 2014 that is part of a larger reef monitoring initiative led by Jenn Burt, Anne Salomon and Kyle Demes. Please contact Jenn or Anne at jenn.burt@gmail.com or Anne.Salomon@sfu.ca for more details on these data.

Column headers for the file “Hind et al_Site Survey Data.csv”:

Site = reef site with numbers corresponding to sites shown in Figure 1
Quadrat = number for each 1x1m quadrat (n=18 in total per site)
ALLurchinbiomass = total biomass for red and green urchins in each quadrat
ALLstipesAdult = kelp stipe count for all adult kelps (Nereocystis luetkeana, Macrocystis pyrifera Pterygophora california and Laminaria spp.)

(2) Hind et al_Coralline Quad Data.xlsx

These data are the quadrat-level measurements of abundance for genetically identified species of coralline algae at subtidal kelp forest (n = 2) and urchin barren (n = 2) rocky reef sites. Each row represents a ‘morphospecies’ that was later identified by DNA sequencing. Therefore, species may appear more than once in a single quadrat. Please contact Katy Hind at Katy.hind@gmail.com or Patrick Martone at patrick.martone@botany.ubc.ca for more information on these data.

Column headers for the file “Hind et al_Coralline Quad Data.xlsx
Date = date of survey
Site = site at which sample was taken
Quadrat No. = number for each quadrat (n = 6 per site)
Depth nc (m) = exact depth at which quadrat was laid
Original Det. = name given to each morphospecies in the field (often unidentified)
Sample# = ID number given to each morphospecies; this number is unique only within each quadrat
comments = any additional comments made at time of sampling
PTM# = Collection number given to voucher of each morphospecies
Code = unique code given to each morphospecies; combines Sample# and Quadrat No. 
Species name (Provisional name) = final determination of each morphospecies after sequencing. Species names are the names used in the publication; if species names differ from provisional names given to known species that need description, this is specified.
% cover = percentage cover of each morphospecies in each quadrat

(3) Hind et al_Crust thickness.xlsx

These data are crust thickness measurements taken from individual specimens of various (n = 16) species. 

Column headers for the file “Hind et al_Crust thickness.xlsx”:
Species = Species name used in the publication for each specimen, with provisional name given in brackets (if different)
Accession # = UBC Herbarium accession number for each specimen
PTM # = Collection number for each specimen
Thickness (um) = crust thickness measurement from each specimen
Site # = site at which specimen was collected; ‘supplemental’ refers to collections made outside of field sites from this study
Features = additional notes on the features (e.g. texture, colour) of each crust
